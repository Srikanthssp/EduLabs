# Call Center data analysis using Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI 

## Background:
You are a technology consultant working with a leading call center that is determined to enhance its customer service and operational efficiency. The call center handles a diverse range of customer inquiries, feedback, and support issues on a daily basis. The management has decided to leverage advanced technologies to extract valuable insights from customer conversations and improve overall performance.

## Objectives:
The main objectives of this hands-on lab are to implement real-time and post-call analytics using Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI Service. The goal is to gain actionable insights, understand customer sentiment, and optimize call center operations. This immersive experience will guide you through a diverse range of topics related to data processing, audio transcription, sentiment analysis, and data visualization, allowing you to master real-time and post-call analytics.

## Lab Steps:

* Data Processing:

In the initial phase, you'll be working with raw audio recordings of customer calls. Your task is to process and clean the data to ensure it's ready for analysis.

* Audio Transcription:

Leveraging Azure AI services, you will transcribe the audio data into text. This step is crucial for converting spoken words into a format that can be easily analyzed.

* Sentiment Analysis:

Applying sentiment analysis to the transcribed text, you'll categorize each customer interaction as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps in understanding the overall sentiment of the customer base.

* Real-Time Analytics:

Implementing real-time analytics, you'll integrate Azure AI services into the call center infrastructure. This enables immediate analysis of live customer calls, providing instant insights to customer service representatives.

* Post-Call Analytics:

Moving beyond real-time analysis, you'll explore historical customer conversations. Extracting trends and patterns from past interactions will aid in making informed decisions and improving long-term customer satisfaction.

* Data Visualization:

To make the insights more accessible, you will create interactive dashboards. Visualizing customer sentiment trends, call volumes, and other key metrics will empower the call center management to monitor and act upon the information effectively.

## Expected Outcomes:

* Enhanced customer satisfaction by addressing issues in real-time and understanding long-term trends.
* Improved operational efficiency through insights gained from both real-time and post-call analytics.
* Empowered customer service representatives with tools to better understand and respond to customer needs.
* Data-driven decision-making for the call center management, leading to strategic improvements in service delivery.
* Through this immersive hands-on experience, participants will not only learn the technical aspects of implementing these technologies but also gain valuable insights into the strategic advantages of leveraging AI in a call center environment.

## Dataflow

 * A phone call between an agent and a customer is recorded and stored in Azure Blob Storage.
 * Azure AI Speech is used to transcribe audio files. The transcription results are persisted in Blob Storage.
 * Azure OpenAI is used to process the transcript and extract entities, summarize the conversation, and analyze sentiments. The processed output is stored in SQL Database.
 * Power BI is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) that provides visual and interactive insights for business analytics. It provides transformation capabilities and connects to data sources.

## Lab Overview

In this Hands-on-lab, you will perform the following tasks.

+ Task 1: Provision Azure resources.
